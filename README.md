## Summary

* Use stem, which is a python wrapper of Tor, to communicate annonymously.


* The server currently could response with HTTP GET request and websocket request.


* curl-get.sh: a curl client for testing.

* The additional packages are listed in requirements.txt


## to-do-list
* I haven't tested whether the server could get the client address;

* The basic architecture of this forum is based on P2P network. For simplicity, I started with the structure of Server/Client.
